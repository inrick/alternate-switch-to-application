Alternate Switch To Application
===============================

GNOME Shell extension that offers an alternate implementation of "switch to
application". Works with GNOME 46. It cycles through the application's windows
instead of activating all of them at once. If the application does not have any
windows, a new instance is started.

Before enabling the extension, make sure to disable the default switch to
application bindings:

```
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-1 "[]"
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-2 "[]"
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-3 "[]"
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-4 "[]"
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-5 "[]"
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-6 "[]"
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-7 "[]"
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-8 "[]"
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-9 "[]"
```
